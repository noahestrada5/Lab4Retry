# Lab4Retry

## Purpose
I created this map for one of my labs for a course at App State. It represents the percentage of land by state that belongs to the public (i.e. National Parks). This is important for many reasons. What comes to mind for me is accessibility to outdoor recreation, seeing that public land is often linked to these types of activities. The Retry at the end of my repo name is because of some errors I encountered in my first attempts at uploading everything to GitHub. 

## Data
The data came from an article that cited the US Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1991 (11th ed.) Washington, DC, 1991, p.201. Seeing that this data is from 30+ years ago, a lot probabaly changed (hopefully). For the sake of this being a class project, I did not feel the need to find very up to date information. Rather, this is just for my personal knowledge of web mapping.

## Symbolization and Design
I used proportional symbols to represent the percentages. As you'd infer, states with more public lands have larger circles. I used green because I see that as being the color that represents public lands the best. I used satellite imagery for a base map because it highlights the type of land a state would have to offer to the public, if one wouldn't know already.
